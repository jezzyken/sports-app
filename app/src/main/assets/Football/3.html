<h3> Defensive Football Strategy </h3>  


<br>
Football defenses today run numerous plays and formations throughout a game. The number of defensive linemen can vary from three to five. The number of linebacker can vary as well. Also, many teams will use 5 defensive backs in passing situations call the nickel defense. 
<br><br>
One of the main strategies of football defenses against the pass is the blitz. This is when a player that would normally not rush the passer, rushes the passer. This may be a defensive back or a line backer. Many teams change up who is blitzing and how many players are blitzing nearly every play. Some teams blitz more than others. The advantage of the blitz is that a football team is more likely to get a sack or to give the quarterback less time to throw the football. The disadvantage is that there are less players downfield to tackle a runner or to cover receivers. 
<br><br>
A defensive football strategy that is used late in games is the prevent defense. This usually means the defense has an extra defensive back and that the defenders are all staying behind the receivers. They will allow the offense to make a short pass or run in order to prevent a long pass from being successful.
