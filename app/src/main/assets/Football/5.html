		<li>All players must play at least half of the game (2 quarters). Also, no player may play all 4 quarters unless every other player has played 3 quarters. </li>

		<li>Visiting team starts the kickoff of the game.</li>
		<li>The referee will keep track of scoring only to institute the 3/5 rule when needed.</li>
		<li>3/5 Rule:  If one team goes up by 3 goals, the opposing team must add 1 additional field player to the game.  If the team with the extra player scores, the additional player must be removed.

This second player is in addition to the player that was added when the team was down by 3 goals.</li>
