<h3> Offensive Football Strategy </h3>  

<br>

<br><br>Each team has their own style of play and a strategy of how they like to play football. This strategy may be determined by the skill set of the players or the players may be chosen to fit into the strategy. 

<br><br>Some offensive football teams focus on the run. The offensive line will be chosen for their skills at run blocking. Tight ends and receivers are usually skilled blockers as well. Also, the backs will be chosen with run blocking and rushing skills in mind. In a college option offense, even the quarterback will be foremost a runner and only a passer in long yardage situations. A run oriented offense is often called ball-control offense. By running a team uses up time on the clock and also give their defense a chance to rest. Running teams tend to turn the ball over less and can keep the game to a lower score. Running football teams are good for using up the clock when they have a lead, but have a more difficult time coming from behind. 

<br><br>Other offensive football teams focus on the pass. In this case the offensive line needs to be able to pass block. In this offense the tight end, running backs, and receivers are foremost skilled at catching passes. A pass oriented football team is usually formed around a great passing quarterback. Passing teams are good at scoring quickly and making comebacks, but use up less clock and are more prone to turnovers. 

<br><br>Most teams try to be skilled at both passing and rushing the football. This balanced attack can keep the defense guessing and allows for more varied play calling depending on the game situation.
