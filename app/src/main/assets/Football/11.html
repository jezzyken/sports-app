<h3> Warm-Up for Footballl</h3>  
<p>Before performing any exercise, it is important to prepare the body by performing a warm up. Warming up better prepares the body for sport performance and can help decrease the risk of injury. The warm up for football should be done before each exercise session - whether it be competition matches, on the pitch training sessions and gym sessions.</p>

<h3>Example Football Warm-Up</h3>  

<div id="clFndContent">
	<ul>  
		<li>3 laps of the soccer pitch at a slow run (include running sideways/backwards, lifting knees up and kicking heels backward)</li>
		<li>10 minute stretch involving dynamic and static stretch</li>
		<li>1 lap of the soccer pitch</li>
		<li>10 Ã— 20m length runs (work from 50% effort sprint to maximal sprint)</li>
		<li>5 x 10m out and back short sprints</li>
		<li>10 zigzag runs (75% effort)</li>
		<li>soccer specific drills</li>
	
	</ul>
 </div>

<h3> Special Considerations</h3>  
<p>The goalkeeper has very specific fitness demands. Warmups for the goalkeeper should concentrate on explosive power and flexibility. Prior to matches, the goalie will also do a session in the goals to hone their reflexes.</p>

<p>If there are extended rest periods where the players are not performing, for example resting on the bench, they may have to go through some of these procedures again to keep the muscles and joints ready to safely and consistently perform.</p>
