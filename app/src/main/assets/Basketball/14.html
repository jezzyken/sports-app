 <h3> Treatment and Cures </h3>  

 <p>
  As in any team sports, flexibility is key. Keeping muscles supple and loose is vital for keeping strains and sprains to a minimum. Basketball players should concentrate on the upper body, especially the arms, neck, and shoulders, performing at-home stretches and strengthening these muscles on gym machines in-between games.

  Knees, too, are problem areas in basketball. The best treatment here is exercise, specifically leg lifts and machines that strengthen the knee's supporting muscles. Wearing an Ace bandage on an already sore knee can help prevent it from getting worse, but unless you're a pro, you're best off staying off the court until it heals.
