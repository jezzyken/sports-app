<h3> Fouls </h3>  
A personal foul occurs when there is illegal contact between two opponents. A player who makes more than five personal fouls is excluded from the game.<br>
A foul made on a player attempting a shot results in the awarding of the same number of free-throws as those of the shot taken (two from inside the arc, three from outside). If a player is fouled but makes the attempted shot, the shot counts and an additional free-throw will be awarded.<br>
Once a team has made four fouls in a period, each additional foul (on a player not attempting a shot) will result in the automatic awarding of two free-throws.
