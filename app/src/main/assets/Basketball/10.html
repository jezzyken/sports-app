 <h3> Strategy  </h3>  

 <p>
        When you are watching a game of basketball on television, it can sometimes seem like there are just a bunch of players out there dribbling the ball around and chucking it for a goal. The game can appear chaotic. But basketball is a very strategic game. Teams are in fact running sophisticated defenses and setting up and running multiple offensive plays. Coaches on the sideline are constantly studying the game, making sure they have the right players in the game, making adjustments, and trying to outsmart the other team.
