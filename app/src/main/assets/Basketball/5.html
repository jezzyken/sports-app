<h3> Moving the ball </h3>  
The ball may either be passed from one player to another, or dribbled by a player from one point to another (bounced while walking or running).<br>
Before passing or shooting the ball, a player may take two steps (without dribbling).<br>
Once a player has stopped dribbling, he may not start to dribble again.<br>
Once the team in possession of the ball has passed the half-court line, it may not cross back over the line with the ball.
