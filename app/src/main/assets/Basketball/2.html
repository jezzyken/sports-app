 <h3> Basketball Defensive Strategy   </h3>  
<br>
 Although scoring is exciting, fun to watch, and fun to do; defense is a key to winning any basketball game. Teams often change up defenses and change who is guarding who during the game. There are two main types of defenses: zone defense and man-to-man defense. 
 <br><br>
 The zone defense is where each player has a specific area of the court they are responsible to defend. The zone shifts and moves depending on where the offensive players are standing and where the ball is. Zone defenses are great for stopping inside scoring as multiple players can surround or "collapse" on a player getting the ball on the inside. They are not as good at stopping outside or long shots. So zone defenses are often deployed against offensive basketball teams that have a strong inside offensive game, but a weak outside game. 
 <br><br>
 Man-to-man defense is where each player is assigned to cover a specific offensive player. The player guards the offensive player wherever they go on the court. Man-to-man defense can be very affective against a strong outside shooting team. Man-to-man can also help with rebounding as each defender can block out the person they are guarding and no one can slip into open zones like they can on zone defense. 
 <br><br>
 Sometimes teams run a combination of zone and man-to-man. One example of this is the box-and-one. In this defense four players play zone (in a box shape) and one player plays man-to-man usually on the offensive team's best player.
 
 <br><br>
 Other basketball defensive strategies include: 
 <br>
 Full court press - where a team will play defense over the entire court hoping to trap or steal the ball. 
 <br>
 Double Team - where two players will cover the player with the ball
