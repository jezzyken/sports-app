<h3> Service </h3>  
<p>
	All serves that fall in the opponent's service box and are served from behind the out-of-bounds lines are counted as good serves. In lawn tennis, a server is allowed to make underhanded serves. The service can only be counted as legal when the opponent is ready to receive it. The server loses the point if he makes a double fault on his serve (that is, he cannot get a good serve despite having two chances to do so).
