<h3> Tennis Rules and Regulations </h3>  
<p>
	Like any sport, tennis is also ruled by some strict rules and regulations. Any tennis player found guilty of breaching these rules is subject to disciplinary action by the governing body of the court where the match is being played. It is expected that all the players know the tennis rules before they go to play professional tennis, anywhere in the world. For the entire set of tennis rules, you may have to grab a copy of the official tennis rules and regulations dossier, of the International Tennis Federation (ITF). The ITF has a 'Rules of Tennis Committee', which helps it make and implement these rules. Let us have a look at some of the rules and regulations in this article.

<h4> Rules and Regulations of Tennis </h4>  
<p>The rules of tennis extend from court rules all the way to the tennis rules of the game during play. Below is a relatively cropped-up list of tennis rules and regulations, some general and some game related. We will not go into the details of the rules governing the tennis court dimensions, the fixtures on court and the sizes and lengths of various things. We will just get to business and see the rules that you should know as a tennis player</p>
