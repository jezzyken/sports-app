<h3> Tennis Gear </h3>  
<p>As with most sports, when playing professional tennis, the tennis players are expected to wear proper tennis shoes. This rule was made to protect the tennis court from blemishes and tread marks. Black-soled shoes are not allowed on the court, as they may leave blemishes on the court.</p>
