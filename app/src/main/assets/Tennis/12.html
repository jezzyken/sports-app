<h3> Warm-Up for Tennis</h3>  
<p>Before performing any exercise, it is important to prepare the body by performing a warm up. Warming up better prepares the body for sport performance and can help decrease the risk of injury. The warm up for football should be done before each exercise session - whether it be competition matches, on the pitch training sessions and gym sessions.</p>

<h3>Example Tennis Match Warm-Up</h3>  

<div id="clFndContent">
	<ul>  
		<li>3-5 minutes slow jog, or if there is no space for that you can running on the spot, skipping or jumping jacks.</li>
		<li>15 minutes of stretching - involving dynamic and static stretches, both the upper and lower body. examples include arm circles, trunk twists, toe touching and high knees.</li>
		<li>5 Ã— court runs (work from 50% effort sprint to maximal sprint).</li>
		<li>5 shuttles across the court (75% effort).</li>
		<li>5 shuttles across the court (75% effort).</li>

<h3> Special Considerations</h3>  
<p>If there is an extended rest period from the time you have finished warming up to the start of the match, you may have to go through some of these procedures again to prepare the muscles and joints to safely begin the game.</p>

<p>It is also important to have an adequate warm down after the match</p>
