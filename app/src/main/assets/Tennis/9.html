<h3> Tennis Rackets </h3>  
<p>
	A tennis racket is only legal if it has all the stitches attached and unbroken, does not have any energy source attached that can affect the play and does not have more than one set of stringed patterns on it. Vibration dampening devices are only allowed if they are placed outside the criss-crossed string pattern
