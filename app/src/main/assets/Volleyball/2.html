<h3> Volleyball: Guidelines </h3>  
<h4> SPORTSMANSHIP  </h4>  
<p>
	Sportsmanship is an important part of any successful athletic team or activity.  The Southern Vermont College Intramural Program promotes sound sportsmanship and insists that all participants keep it in mind while participating in SVC Intramurals.  The intramural program is designed to be a fun, casual way for students, faculty and staff to be involved physically and socially.

<h4> Gameplay </h4>  

<h4>Game Length </h4>  
A.  Matches will be played with 3 games, each being played to 30 points.<br>
i. The team with the most points after 2 of the 3 games wins the match.<br>
ii. Teams will switch sides of the court after each game.<br>
B.  There will be a 3 minute break between games. 

<h4>Pre Game </h4>  
A.  A coin flip will determine which team serves first.<br>
i. The team that will call heads/tails will be that which did not get to pick first in team selection.  <br> 
ii. The team that did not win the coin flip will decide which side of the court they would like to defend first. 

<h4>Maneuvers, Techniques, & Game Play </h4>  
A.  Each rally must start with a serve.
i. The server must be behind the back line while making the serve.  Being on or over the line will result in a fault.  After two faults, the serve is given to the other team.<br> 
ii. The serve can be overhand or underhand, so long as not carried.  A carried serve will result in serve being given to the other team.<br> 
iii. If a serve touches the net and goes over, it is a fault.  If the serve does not make it over the net, the serve is given to the other team. <br> 
iv. Teams must rotate servers so that one player does not serve twice before all the other players on the court have served once.<br> 
B.  Teams have up to 3 hits to get the ball over the net.  Not being able to do so will stop the rally and give the serve to the other team.

<h4>Scoring </h4>  
A.  A point is scored on every rally.  The team getting the point will also get or retain the serve. <br> 
i. A team does not need to be serving to get a point.<br> 
B.  After a team reaches 10 and 20 points during each game, substitutions must be made to get all participants equal playing time. <br> 
C.  Once a team gets to 30, they win the game and teams switch sides of the court.<br> 
i. Games must be won by 2 points.  Games will continue to be played past 30 points until one team has 2 over.


<h4>Boundaries </h4>  
A.  The yellow lines will mark the boundaries.  If a ball lands out of bounds on a direct hit over the net, the team not hitting will get the serve.<br> 
i. If the ball lands in bounds, the serve is given to the team on the opposite side of the court.<br> 
B.  Hits over the net must go through the sticks on top of the net poles.<br> 
i. A ball that hits the sticks or goes over them will be considered out of bounds and the serve will be given to the team not hitting the ball.<br> 
C.  Players can play the ball out of bounds, as long as it doesn't hit anything.  This includes the ceiling and lights, basketball hoops, the official's stand, and the net poles.
