<h3> WWarm-Up for Volleyball</h3>  
<p>Before performing any exercise, it is important to prepare the body by performing a warm up. Warming up better prepares the body for sport performance and can help decrease the risk of injury. The warm up for football should be done before each exercise session - whether it be competition matches, on the pitch training sessions and gym sessions.</p>

<h3>Example Volleyball Warm-Up</h3>  

<div id="clFndContent">
	<ul>  
		<li>a slow jog (a lap or two of the oval, or if inside a few laps of the gym)</li>
		<li>15 minutes of stretching - involving static stretches (quads, hamstrings, calves, torso, shoulders) followed by dynamic stretches (arm circles, leg swings).</li>
		<li>runs up and down along the side of the court. Running forwards and backwards, side shuffles, leg crossovers,</li>
		<li>5 Ã— 30m length runs (increase from 50% effort to maximal sprint).</li>
		<li>5 x 10m out and back short sprints</li>
		<li>5 zigzag runs (75% effort).</li>
		<li>volleyball drills such as setting and spiking.</li>
	
	</ul>
 </div>

<h3> Special Considerations</h3>  
<p>If there are extended rest periods where the players are not exercising, for example resting on the side of the court, they may have to go through some of these procedures again to keep the muscles and joints ready to safely and consistently perform.</p>
