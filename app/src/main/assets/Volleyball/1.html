<h3> Common Youth Volleyball Injuries </h3>  

<p>
	There are many injuries associated with volleyball, the most common affecting the joints of the knees, elbows and shoulders.   Volleyball injuries can occur as the long term result of overuse/under-resting, or acute/traumatic injuries sustained during a game or practice.
</p>
<p>
	A 2007 study by the National Athletic Trainers' Association (NATA) found that at the high school level, the highest percentage of injuries affect players' ankles and feet (35.6%); hips, thighs or legs (16.2%); and forearms, wrists or hands (15.8%).

<h4> Tendonitis </h4>  
<p>
	Though less easy to describe or pinpoint accurately, lower back pain develops in many volleyball players and is generally treated with medication (anti-inflammatory medications such as Ibuprofen), light stretching and strengthening or chiropractic visits.  Lower back pain can be very difficult to diagnose and treat.

<h4> Lower Back Pain </h4>  
<p>
	The athlete should not continue with any activity following the injury. A general recommendation is that the knee should be offloaded during the first 24 hours.
</p>

<h4> Rotator Cuff </h4>  
<p>
	Tears or strains of the rotator cuff in the shoulder are common among volleyball players., either acute injuries or as the result of overuse over the course of a season.  Loose/unstable shoulders can develop over time as well. The best way to treat rotator cuff injuries is prevent them from happening in the first place by strengthening exercises.  Rotator cuff injuries have a tendency to be chronic, as the shoulder never seems to sit well and is always affected by gravity. If a rotator cuff injury has been sustained, overhead motions should be limited, ice and anti-inflammatory medication such as Ibuprofin should be taken.  Consultation with a sports medicine specialist is recommended.  Rehabilitation and strengthening, after the pain has subsided, will help prevent future aggravation.
