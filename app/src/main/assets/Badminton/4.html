 <h3> Basic principles </h3>  
<p>
	PRICE  is comprised of basic principles in the treatment of acute injuries, but should always be tailored to the injury type and site. Always use common sense. If a serious injury is suspected, contact emergency services. 
</p>

<h4> Protection </h4>  
<p>
	In this context, it means to remove the athlete from play to protect against further injury. This is especially important in the first 48 hours after the injury occurred.
</p>

<h4> Rest </h4>  
<p>
	The athlete should not continue with any activity following the injury. A general recommendation is that the knee should be offloaded during the first 24 hours.
</p>

<h4> Ice </h4>  
<p>
	The  aim of applying ice is to relieve pain. 20 minutes with an ice pack every other hour for a day or two has a good effect. 
</p>

<h4> Compression </h4>  
<p>
	The most important aspect of first aid treatment for acute knee injuries is compression. This can reduce swelling. Use an elastic bandage and start wrapping it around the knee. Start from below the knee and finish slightly above it. The bandage should be as tight as possible, without stopping blood flow past the injury site.  Signs that the bandage is too tight can include numbness, tingling and increased pain.
</p>

<h4> Elevation </h4>  
<p>
	Swelling in the knee can often be limited by keeping the knee elevated. Let the foot rest above hip level on a chair or cushion. This is particularly important in the first few hours, but it is best to continue to keep it elevated as much as possible for the first 24 hours. Remember that compression should be maintained around the clock to keep internal bleeding (swelling) to a minimum.
