<h3> Warm-Up for Basketball</h3>  
<p>Before performing any exercise, it is important to prepare the body by performing an appropriate warm-up. Warming up prepares the body for the upcoming activities and can help decrease the risk of injury. The warm-up for basketball should be done before every exercise session - whether it be for competition games, practice sessions, or gym workouts.</p>

<h3> Example Basketball Warm-Up</h3>  

<p>A basketball game can involve an extended period of explosive jumping and rapid change of direction. To get the body prepared for such activities, a thorough warm-up is required. The warm-up should focus on the specific actions and muscle groups that will be involved in the activity, and gradually move from low intensity to high intensity.</p>
