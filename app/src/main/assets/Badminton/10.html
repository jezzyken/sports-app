<h3> Single badminton Strategies </h3>  
<br>
One simple badminton strategy often used in singles is to serve long and high to your opponent's back court. This will force your opponent to move back to the baseline and open up his forecourt.
<br><br>
Throw in some disguised low serve occasionally and you might just catch your opponent off guard and win a point outright.
<br><br>
Nowadays in professional men's singles, you seldom see them use the long serve. This is because the professional players are extremely athletic and possess great techniques. They can jump really high and smash powerfully even from the baseline.
<br><br>
It all depends who you are playing with. If the high serve turns out to be your opponent's favorite and put you under pressure, use the low serve.
<br><br>
Always try to hit the shuttle away from your opponent and make your opponent move around the court. One exception to this rule is that when you encounter a tall opponent, you might want to smash straight to his body to gain an advantage.
<br><br>
Observe your opponent's strength, weakness, favorite shots and pattern of play. Use it to your advantage.
<br><br>
Your aim is to make your opponent play a weak return, such as a weak backhand shot from the back court. If your plan works and forces a mistake or a poor return which you can make a 'kill', use it again. If it is not working then have the courage to make changes. The key is to be flexible.
<br><br>
If you are in a difficult situation in the game and your opponent is not, you need to make time for yourself to get back to a favorable position. Do this by hitting the shuttle high towards the back of the court, preferably near the middle of the baseline. Your opponent will find it difficult to catch you out with acute angled returns from there.
<br><br>
Remember always to get back to your base position in the midcourt area after making each shot. This is a position where you can possibly reach any of your opponent's shots.
