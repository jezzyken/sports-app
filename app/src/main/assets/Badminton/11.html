<h3> Strategies </h3>  
<p>
    Being able to use Badminton Strategies in your game is essential in winning you crucial points and games. Just knowing how to smash powerfully will not bring you success if you don't have a game plan. You have to use some badminton tactics and badminton strategies to outwit your opponent.

<p>
    Always remember that you are trying to make your opponent play a weak shot in which you will be able to make a 'kill'. Too many beginners try to make every shot a winning shot instead of a negotiating shot to play a winning game.
